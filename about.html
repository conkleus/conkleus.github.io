            <p>Bill Conkle and Christina Olesten founded Conkle & Olesten in 1982. After practising with that firm for over thirty years, Bill and Christina founded a new Conkle & Olesten in October of 2013 to improve service to clients.</p><br>

            <h3>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND BRAND PROTECTION</h3> 
				<p>For decades, Bill has been developing and protecting intellectual property rights, from obtaining design patents on nail polish bottles to federal trademark protection on product fragrances. Conkle & Olesten helps clients to identify protectable intellectual property and obtain federal protection.</p>
				<p>In the personal care and salon industries, Bill leads the fight against counterfeiting and diversion. Bill's innovative brand protection methods have included helping manufacturers identify diverters through the use of product tracking and pioneering the use of federal anti-racketeering and criminal laws against diverters and counterfeiters. The bad guys are constantly changing their schemes. To thwart them, Conkle & Olesten continuously devises and implements new strategies to stay one step ahead of them.<br></p>
			<h3>TRIAL PRACTICE</h3>
				<p>Conkle & Olesten was initially formed to provide clients with a law firm willing to try cases before juries rather than settle them. Bill and his attorneys have obtained several multi-million dollar verdicts which have been affirmed and paid. They have also obtained verdicts for their clients dismissing improvident cases. Members of the firm are willing and ready to forcefully fight their client's case before a jury rather than make an unfair settlement. Our lawyers are also skilled in non-jury and arbitration proceedings.<br></p>
			<h3>BUSINESS LAW</h3>
				<p>Conkle & Olesten establishes corporations and limited liability companies and helps clients operate their businesses. Members of Conkle & Olesten draft all types of contracts, including manufacturing contracts, distribution agreements, and real estate contracts. Persons breaching Conkle & Olesten contracts can expect to be sued and have to defend themselves at trial.<br></p>
			<h3>INSURANCE BAD FAITH AND INSURANCE COVERAGE</h3> 
				<p>We fight for policy owners and insureds to enforce their rights against insurance companies. In the early 1980's, few law firms were willing to pursue insurance companies. As a result, liability insurers frequently refused to defend claims and suits against their insureds. Bill, along with a few other lawyers across the country, changed that. He convinced the lawyer directory, Martindale Hubbell, to develop a new category: Enforcing Policyholders Rights. After successful suits against the Who's Who of insurance companies, they are not as cavaleer about abandoning their insureds. Members of Conkle & Olesten achieved multi-million dollar settlements against companies in the AIG Group. Bill and firm member Ben Milam hammered Scottsdale Insurance Company in a jury trial after it refused to pay $68,000 to defend its insureds. A jury verdict of $4.5 million was affirmed in an appeal and paid by the insurer.<br></p>
